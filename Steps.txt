So we shall not go in the depth of how the attck works in this txt file. This file is just a short notes on how to attck is monted. 

Refer here: https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf

In the AES we have a array lookup T0[k[0] xor n[0]] now this is a array lookup and the time of aes depends on this lookup; so AES Timing can leak info in k[0] xor n[0]; (k is the Key and n is the Plain Text; not are 16 bytes so n[0] is one byte).
So one can deduce the exact value of k[0] using the distribution of AES timings as a function of n[0]. Similarly for all k[0] to k[15].


To say this simply: 
1) Attacker watches the time taken by AES for many n's
2) Total the AES times for each possible n[13] (or any other n[i])
3) Observes the overall AES is max when n[13] is 147

Now the Attckers gets access to a computer with the exact same specification and does the same with a known keys. Here he observes he gets a max with n[13] xor k[13] = 8.
So we can conclude that k[13] = 147 xor 8 = 155.


Steps to Run:

Follow the steps in section 5 and section 6 to perfeorm the attack. Take the IP as 0.0.0.0 as we are running on our own systems.


Once you get the output of correlate, check it in attack. This step will show the possible key values for each k[0] to k[15], I'm getting all 255 values for all of them.
